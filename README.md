# ðŸš— Async Race â€“ Racing Game with REST API

## ðŸ§© Overview
A web application that allows users to create, customize, and race virtual cars. The app communicates with a backend API to manage the garage, race events, and winners table.  
Built to practice asynchronous JavaScript, API requests, and dynamic UI updates.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **HTML5 & CSS3** â€“ Layout, styling, and responsive design  
- **TypeScript** â€“ Strong typing, maintainable code structure  
- **REST API** â€“ Async communication with backend server ([API Repository](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api))  
- **Webpack** â€“ Project bundling and asset optimization  
- **ES6 Modules** â€“ Code splitting and modular architecture

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Garage Management** â€“ Add, edit, and delete cars  
- **Racing Mode** â€“ Start/stop races, view winners in real-time  
- **Animations** â€“ Smooth car movement during races  
- **Winners Table** â€“ Stores results with sorting and pagination  
- **API Integration** â€“ GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests

## ðŸ§­ Learning Outcomes
- Implemented **async/await** for cleaner asynchronous code  
- Worked with **fetch API** and RESTful endpoints  
- Used **TypeScript** to reduce runtime errors and improve code clarity  
- Learned **state synchronization** between frontend and backend

## ðŸš€ How to Run
